1.take pcap (UNSW-NB15 dataset) (scapy library) *
  Interesting Features:
  - srcip, dstip (source/destination IPs)
  - sport, dsport (source/destination ports)
  - proto (protocol type)
  - dur (flow duration)
  - stime, ltime (start and end times of a flow)
  - state (FIN, SYN, ACK - communication)
  - service (HTTP, FTP)
  - sbytes, dbytes (source and destination bytes)
  - rate (average bytes per second)
  - label (Normal or Malicious)
  - attack_cat (Attack category,port scanning, fingerprinting, Backdoor, DoS, Exploits, Reconnaissance, Worms)

 Take what is useful from the packets
 * Might not be necessary with existing .csv but definately useful for better analysis/understanding
  
2.visualize networks (networkX) *

3. slice into time segments (based on time intervals)
  - Slice segments into time intervals (dur or s/ltime)
  - Oscar's code?
    
4. represent segments as vector (bert, word2vec)
   
6. train autoencoder with vectors (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
   
8. find reconstruction error (Time segment vs reconstruction error graph?)
   
10. evaluate based on TP, TN, FP, FN
