1.take pcap (UNSW-NB15 dataset) (scapy library) *
  Interesting Features:
  - srcip, dstip (source/destination IPs)
  - sport, dsport (source/destination ports)
  - proto (protocol type)
  - dur (flow duration)
  - stime, ltime (start and end times of a flow)
  - state (FIN, SYN, ACK - communication)
  - service (HTTP, FTP)
  - sbytes, dbytes (source and destination bytes)
  - rate (average bytes per second)
  - label (Normal or Malicious)
  - attack_cat (Attack category,port scanning, fingerprinting, Backdoor, DoS, Exploits, Reconnaissance, Worms)

 Take what is useful from the packets
 * Might not be necessary with existing .csv but definately useful for better analysis/understanding
  
2.visualize networks (networkX) *
  - Not sure how yet

 * If this is only for the graph method then might not be necessary

3. slice into time segments (based on time intervals)
  - Slice segments into time intervals (dur or s/ltime)
  - Different segment size options
  - Oscar's code?
    
4. represent segments as vector
  - BERT
  - word2vec

5. train autoencoder with vectors (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
  - train set on non encoded? 
   
6. find reconstruction error 
   - Time segment vs reconstruction error graph?
   
7. evaluate based on TP, TN, FP, FN 
  - for different embedders
  - different data?
